        <h1>Mahomedali Jinnahbhai:</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Mahomedali Jinnahbhai</b> 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister, politician, and the
          founder
          of Pakistan. Jinnah served
          as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and
          then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.

          Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his
          return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which
          eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first
          two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim
          unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which
          Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a
          fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian
          subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
          satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.

          By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid
          the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim
          League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims. During
          the Second World War, the Muslim League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in
          the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims.
          Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the
          entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree
          instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.

          As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and
          policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India after the
          partition in August 1947, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died a year after
          Pakistan's creation and was buried at Mazar-e-Quaid. He is revered in Pakistan as the Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of
          the Nation") and Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader"). His birthday is observed as a national holiday in Pakistan.

        <h1>Education in England</h1>
        <p>
          In 1892, Sir Frederick Leigh Croft, a business associate of Jinnahbhai Poonja, offered young Jinnah a London
          apprenticeship with his firm, Graham's Shipping and Trading Company.[21] He accepted the position despite the
          opposition of his mother, who before he left, had him enter an arranged marriage with his cousin, two years
          his junior from the ancestral village of Paneli, Emibai Jinnah. Jinnah's mother and first wife both died
          during his absence in England.[22] Although the apprenticeship in London was considered a great opportunity
          for Jinnah, one reason for sending him overseas was a legal proceeding against his father, which placed the
          family's property at risk of being sequestered by the court. In 1893, the Jinnahbhai family moved to
          Bombay.[17]

          Soon after his arrival in London, Jinnah gave up the business apprenticeship in order to study law, enraging
          his father, who had, before his departure, given him enough money to live for three years. The aspiring
          barrister joined Lincoln's Inn, later stating that the reason he chose Lincoln's over the other Inns of Court
          was that over the main entrance to Lincoln's Inn were the names of the world's great lawgivers, including
          Muhammad. Jinnah's biographer Stanley Wolpert notes that there is no such inscription, but inside (covering
          the wall at one end of New Hall, also called the Great Hall, which is where students, Bar, and Bench lunch and
          dine)[23] is a mural showing Muhammad and other lawgivers, and speculates that Jinnah may have edited the
          story in his own mind to avoid mentioning a pictorial depiction which would be offensive to many Muslims.[24]
          Jinnah's legal education followed the pupillage (legal apprenticeship) system, which had been in force there
          for centuries. To gain knowledge of the law, he followed an established barrister and learned from what he
          did, as well as from studying law-books.[25] During this period, he shortened his name to Muhammad Ali
          Jinnah.[26]

          During his student years in England, Jinnah was influenced by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other
          future Indian independence leaders. His main intellectual references were peoples like Bentham, Mill, Spencer,
          and Comte.[27][28] This political education included exposure to the idea of the democratic nation, and
          progressive politics.[29] He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji
          and Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly
          before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central. Jinnah listened to
          Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.[30][31]

          The Western world not only inspired Jinnah in his political life, but also greatly influenced his personal
          preferences, particularly when it came to dress. Jinnah abandoned local garb for Western-style clothing, and
          throughout his life he was always impeccably dressed in public. His suits were designed by Savile Row tailor
          Henry Poole & Co.[32] He came to own over 200 suits, which he wore with heavily starched shirts with
          detachable collars, and as a barrister took pride in never wearing the same silk tie twice.[33] Even when he
          was dying, he insisted on being formally dressed, "I will not travel in my pyjamas."[16] In his later years he
          was usually seen wearing a Karakul hat which subsequently came to be known as the "Jinnah cap".[34]

          Dissatisfied with the law, Jinnah briefly embarked on a stage career with a Shakespearean company, but
          resigned after receiving a stern letter from his father.[35] In 1895, at age 19, he became the youngest
          British Indian to be called to the bar in England.[11] Although he returned to Karachi, he remained there only
          a short time before moving to Bombay.[35]

        <h1>Struggle for Pakistan</h1>
        <p>
          Until the late 1930s, most Muslims of the British Raj expected, upon independence, to be part of a unitary
          state encompassing all of British India, as did the Hindus and others who advocated self-government.[95]
          Despite this, other nationalist proposals were being made. In a speech given at Allahabad to a League session
          in 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal called for a state for Muslims in British India. Rahmat Ali published a pamphlet
          in 1933 advocating a state called "Pakistan" in the Indus Valley, with other names given to Muslim-majority
          areas elsewhere in India.[96] Jinnah and Iqbal corresponded in 1936 and 1937; in subsequent years, Jinnah
          credited Iqbal as his mentor, and used Iqbal's imagery and rhetoric in his speeches.[97]

          Although many leaders of the Congress sought a strong central government for an Indian state, some Muslim
          politicians, including Jinnah, were unwilling to accept this without powerful protections for their
          community.[95] Other Muslims supported the Congress, which officially advocated a secular state upon
          independence, though the traditionalist wing (including politicians such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and
          Vallabhbhai Patel) believed that an independent India should enact laws such as banning the killing of cows
          and making Hindi a national language. The failure of the Congress leadership to disavow Hindu communalists
          worried Congress-supporting Muslims. Nevertheless, the Congress enjoyed considerable Muslim support up to
          about 1937.[98]

          Events which separated the communities included the failed attempt to form a coalition government including
          the Congress and the League in the United Provinces following the 1937 election.[99] According to historian
          Ian Talbot, "The provincial Congress governments made no effort to understand and respect their Muslim
          populations' cultural and religious sensibilities. The Muslim League's claims that it alone could safeguard
          Muslim interests thus received a major boost. Significantly, it was only after this period of Congress rule
          that it [the League] took up the demand for a Pakistan state ..."[88]

          Balraj Puri, in his journal article about Jinnah, suggests that the Muslim League president, after the 1937
          vote, turned to the idea of partition in "sheer desperation".[100] Historian Akbar Salahuddin Ahmed suggests
          that Jinnah abandoned hope of reconciliation with the Congress as he "rediscover[ed] his own Islamic roots,
          his own sense of identity, of culture and history, which would come increasingly to the fore in the final
          years of his life".[18] Jinnah also increasingly adopted Muslim dress in the late 1930s.[101] In the wake of
          the 1937 balloting, Jinnah demanded that the question of power sharing be settled on an all-India basis, and
          that he, as president of the League, be accepted as the sole spokesman for the Muslim community.[102]

        <h1>Governor-General</h1>
        <p>
          The Radcliffe Commission, dividing Bengal and Punjab, completed its work and reported to Mountbatten on 12
          August; the last Viceroy held the maps until the 17th, not wanting to spoil the independence celebrations in
          both nations. There had already been ethnically charged violence and movement of populations; publication of
          the Radcliffe Line dividing the new nations sparked mass migration, murder, and ethnic cleansing. Many on the
          "wrong side" of the lines fled or were murdered, or murdered others, hoping to make facts on the ground which
          would reverse the commission's verdict. Radcliffe wrote in his report that he knew that neither side would be
          happy with his award; he declined his fee for the work.[168] Christopher Beaumont, Radcliffe's private
          secretary, later wrote that Mountbatten "must take the blame—though not the sole blame—for the massacres in
          the Punjab in which between 500,000 to a million men, women, and children perished".[169] As many as
          14,500,000 people relocated between India and Pakistan during and after partition.[169] Jinnah did what he
          could for the eight million people who migrated to Pakistan; although by now over 70 and frail from lung
          ailments, he travelled across West Pakistan and personally supervised the provision of aid.[170] According to
          Ahmed, "What Pakistan needed desperately in those early months was a symbol of the state, one that would unify
          people and give them the courage and resolve to succeed."[171]

          Among the restive regions of the new nation was the North-West Frontier Province. The referendum there in July
          1947 had been tainted by low turnout as less than 10 per cent of the population were allowed to vote.[172] On
          22 August 1947, just after a week of becoming governor general, Jinnah dissolved the elected government of Dr.
          Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan.[173] Later on, Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in place by Jinnah in the Pashtun-dominated
          province despite him being a Kashmiri.[174] On 12 August 1948, the Babrra massacre in Charsadda occurred,
          resulting in the death of 400 people aligned with the Khudai Khidmatgar movement.[175]

          Along with Liaquat and Abdur Rab Nishtar, Jinnah represented Pakistan's interests in the Division Council to
          appropriately divide public assets between India and Pakistan.[176] Pakistan was supposed to receive one-sixth
          of the pre-independence government's assets, carefully divided by agreement, even specifying how many sheets
          of paper each side would receive. The new Indian state, however, was slow to deliver, hoping for the collapse
          of the nascent Pakistani government, and reunion. Few members of the Indian Civil Service and the Indian
          Police Service had chosen Pakistan, resulting in staff shortages. Partition meant that for some farmers, the
          markets to sell their crops were on the other side of an international border. There were shortages of
          machinery, not all of which were made in Pakistan. In addition to the massive refugee problem, the new
          government sought to save abandoned crops, establish security in a chaotic situation, and provide basic
          services. According to economist Yasmeen Niaz Mohiuddin in her study of Pakistan, "although Pakistan was born
          in bloodshed and turmoil, it survived in the initial and difficult months after partition only because of the
          tremendous sacrifices made by its people and the selfless efforts of its great leader."[177]

          The Indian Princely States were advised by the departing British to choose whether to join Pakistan or India.
          Most did so prior to independence, but the holdouts contributed to what have become lasting divisions between
          the two nations.[178] Indian leaders were angered at Jinnah's attempts to convince the princes of Jodhpur,
          Udaipur, Bhopal, and Indore to accede to Pakistan—the latter three princely states did not border Pakistan.
          Jodhpur bordered it and had both a Hindu-majority population and a Hindu ruler.[179] The coastal princely
          state of Junagadh, which also had a Hindu-majority population, did accede to Pakistan in September 1947, with
          its ruler's dewan, Shah Nawaz Bhutto, personally delivering the accession papers to Jinnah. But the two states
          that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh—Mangrol and Babariawad—declared their independence from
          Junagadh and acceded to India. In response, the nawab of Junagadh militarily occupied the two states.
          Subsequently, the Indian army occupied the principality in November,[180] forcing its former leaders,
          including Bhutto, to flee to Pakistan, beginning the politically powerful Bhutto family.[181]


          Jinnah's arrival at Lahore to discuss the Kashmir crisis in 1948
          The most contentious of the disputes was, and continues to be, that over the princely state of Kashmir. It had
          a Muslim-majority population and a Hindu maharaja, Sir Hari Singh, who stalled his decision on which nation to
          join. With the population in revolt in October 1947, aided by Pakistani irregulars, the maharaja acceded to
          India; Indian troops were airlifted in. Jinnah objected to this action, and ordered that Pakistani troops move
          into Kashmir. The Pakistani Army was still commanded by British officers, and the commanding officer, General
          Sir Douglas Gracey, refused the order, stating that he would not move into what he considered the territory of
          another nation without approval from higher authority, which was not forthcoming. Jinnah withdrew the order.
          This did not stop the violence there, which broke into the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[178][182]

          Some historians allege that Jinnah's courting the rulers of Hindu-majority states and his gambit with Junagadh
          are evidence of ill-intent towards India, as Jinnah had promoted separation by religion, yet tried to gain the
          accession of Hindu-majority states.[183] In his book Patel: A Life, Rajmohan Gandhi asserts that Jinnah hoped
          for a plebiscite in Junagadh, knowing Pakistan would lose, in the hope the principle would be established for
          Kashmir.[184] However, when Mountbatten proposed to Jinnah that, in all the princely States where the ruler
          did not accede to a Dominion corresponding to the majority population (which would have included Junagadh,
          Hyderabad, and Kashmir), the accession should be decided by an 'impartial reference to the will of the
          people', Jinnah rejected the offer.[185][186][187] Despite the United Nations Security Council Resolution 47,
          issued at India's request for a plebiscite in Kashmir after the withdrawal of Pakistani forces, this has never
          occurred.[182]

          In January 1948, the Indian government finally agreed to pay Pakistan its share of British India's assets.
          They were impelled by Gandhi, who threatened a fast until death. Only days later, on 30 January, Gandhi was
          assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who believed that Gandhi was pro-Muslim. After hearing
          about Gandhi's murder on the following day, Jinnah publicly made a brief statement of condolence, calling
          Gandhi "one of the greatest men produced by the Hindu community".[188]

          In February 1948, in a radio talk broadcast addressed to the people of the US,[189] Jinnah expressed his views
          regarding Pakistan's constitution to be in the following way:

          The Constitution of Pakistan is yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly, I do not know what the
          ultimate shape of the constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be of a democratic type,
          embodying the essential principles of Islam. Today these are as applicable in actual life as these were 1300
          years ago. Islam and its idealism have taught us democracy. It has taught equality of man, justice, and fair
          play to everybody. We are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully alive to our
          responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan.

          In March, Jinnah, despite his declining health, made his only post-independence visit to East Pakistan. In a
          speech before a crowd estimated at 300,000, Jinnah stated (in English) that Urdu alone should be the national
          language, believing a single language was needed for a nation to remain united. The Bengali-speaking people of
          East Pakistan strongly opposed this policy, and in 1971 the official language issue was a factor in the
          region's secession to form the country of Bangladesh.[190]
